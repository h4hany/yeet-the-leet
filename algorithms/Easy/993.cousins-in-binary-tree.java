 *
 * In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k
 * node are at depth k+1.
 * 
 * Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have
 * different parents.
 * 
 * We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x
 * and y of two different nodes in the tree.
 * 
 * Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are
 * cousins.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100.
 * Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100.
